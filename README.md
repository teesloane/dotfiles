My dotfiles are a bit scattered. I'm not deicated to one tool or workflow for getting code on the screen.

You can [read](http://tylersloane.com/post/dotfile_discovery/) about my thoughts on getting into customizing my dotfiles. 


## Articles and .rc's that helped me figure this stuff out

- [A Good vimrc](https://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html) << Super useful
- [Theme / aesthetic I borrowed from](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/5vke7s/osx_iterm2_tmux_vim/)
- [Some opinions on themes](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/4bttx2/whats_your_favourite_dark_256colour_theme/)
- [Vim Boostrap](https://vim-bootstrap.com/) - after having created my own `.rc` from scratch it was pretty cool to see what I lacked by looking at this gen'd file. I ended snagging some really powerful plugins out of it that I didn't even know about.
