> Dotfile Dump

**Editor**

- Mostly using [DOOM emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) with a bit
  of customization in ./doom
- There is an old nvim config in /.config but that is dusty and forgotten. (old me)

**Tools**

- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) - LS replacement
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - nice replacement for cat
- [trash](https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash-cli) - great way to not
accidentally destroy all
- [chunkwm](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm) - nice window manager. See
  `./.chunkwmrc`. I believe `.skhdrc` is supposed to manage key commands for
  chunk. Can't remember. `wms` to start, `wmk` to stop
