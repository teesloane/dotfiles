# dotfiles

> Cobbled together vim and tmux + misc.

My dotfiles are a bit scattered. I'm not dedicated to one tool or workflow for getting code on the screen.

You can [read](http://tylersloane.com/post/dotfile_discovery/) about my thoughts on getting into customizing my dotfiles. 

## Getting started

I commented my `.vimrc ` fairly well. Tmux is mostly just ripped from someone else so I still need to figure out what's going on there. KWM is a window manager I sometimes use, and that's just the default config. 

I wrote `link_me.sh` to make sym links between this repo and my root `~/` path, although you should probably inspect the script before you run it because I don't usually write bash scripts / didn't know what I was doing (but it worked for me...I think!)

## Articles and .rc's that helped me figure this stuff out

- [A Good vimrc](https://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html) << Super useful
- [Theme / aesthetic I borrowed from](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/5vke7s/osx_iterm2_tmux_vim/)
- [Some opinions on themes](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/4bttx2/whats_your_favourite_dark_256colour_theme/)
- [Vim Boostrap](https://vim-bootstrap.com/) - after having created my own `.rc` from scratch it was pretty cool to see what I lacked by looking at this gen'd file. I ended snagging some really powerful plugins out of it that I didn't even know about.
